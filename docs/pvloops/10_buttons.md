* We will add a current marker to the PV chart
* We must create a duplicate dataset
* With the same X and Y axes mapping
* Display only the last marker
* With the same color
* Next we will add a reset button
* And assign it the reset model function
* Unfortunately the charts are not clearing
* We need to create an action to clear the charts
* And assign it to the button
* Now we have a working reset button
* We could also use pause and play buttons
* In the last part we will finish up and export the project
