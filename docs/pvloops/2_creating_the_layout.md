* In this tutorial you will learn how to create an interactive simulator application, with charts, animations and simulation controls.
* This is the Bodylight Composer, using this you can create a complete simulator application, let’s start with creating a general layout.
* Drag the Column container to the canvas
* It will contain a three column layout
* Drag two additional Row / Column components into the container
* Select the first column and set it’s width
* by expanding the Flex pane and setting the Flex basis to “40%”
* In the same way set the Flex basis of second and third column to “30%”
* Next we need to select the entire Column container
* Expand the Dimensions pane, set the Height to “100vh”
* Now we want to add rows to our columns
* Switch to the Blocks palette and add Row Containers
* And set their Height to “100%” in the Dimensions pane
* This concludes the layout setup for now
* Next we will show you how to add models and animations
